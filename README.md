# vue-doxen

The world's best Vue.js component documentation tool!

* Designed specifically to work with Vue 3 components (exclusively)
* Fully customizable
* All CSS is optional
* Documentation lives in the component as code (or in separate object if preferred)
* Vue-Doxen is just a Vue componet, so it works anywhere a Vue component would work.
* Generates at runtime, so always up-to-date
* Doesn't require adopting an entire ecosystem or installing tons of dependencies, just use what works with Vue and you're good.


## Using the library
